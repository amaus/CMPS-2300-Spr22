    "# A brief history of OS development\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The first \"OS's\" were collections of functions that could be called to interact with the computer's hardware.\n",
    "   - Batch processing, programs ordered and run by a human\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Mainframes. Many programs could be loaded onto the computer and then run by swapping them\n",
    "   on and off of the CPU.\n",
    "   - Security became paramount. To protect programs from each other and the computer from the programs running on it, the libraries of os calls became **system calls**. \n",
    "   - A system call is very special function that has access to\n",
    "   the computer hardware. When a syscall is made, the OS jumps to a \n",
    "   priviledged mode to perform the task, then \n",
    "   it returns back to user mode and gives control back to the user programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Minicomputers, ex the PDP. Could fit in a single room.\n",
    "   - More developers could now have access to their own computers (within their team).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4) PCs (1980's) - many lessons from the mainframe error were forgotten. \n",
    "   - DOS allowed programs to write over ALL memory.\n",
    "   - Infinite loops on a mac would halt the entire computer\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Modern - Important features and protections have been added back and improved upon and OS's have\n",
    "  proliferated from computers, to phones, watches, etc..."
