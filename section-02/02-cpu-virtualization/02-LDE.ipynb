    "\n",
    "Some operations, like file I/O are super slow. When you want to write to a file, the OS asks the hard disk to perform that write. The harddisk will evetually get back to OS saying that the write is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current process stays on the CPU while this write is happening, millions of cpu cycles are wasted.\n",
