    "To write to a new block in a file (whose inode has room to point to this data block), we need to update:\n",
    "\n",
    "- INODE\n",
    "- DATA BLOCK\n",

    "\n",
    "### Crash Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The DATA BLOCK is written, but nothing else.\n",
    "    - The user's data has been written, but neither the BITMAP nor INODE have.\n",
    "    - This is as if the data wasn't written since the inode doesn't refer to that data block. From the user's perspective, they lost data.\n",
    "    - From, the system's perspective, everything is still consistent. \n",
    "2) The BITMAP is written, but nothing else.\n",
    "    - The bitmap will day that the block is claimed, but the inode won't refer to it.Since no file refers to it, it can NEVER be freed.\n",
    "    - This is space leak. The file system is permanently 4KB smaller.\n",
    "    - The inodes and bitmaps disagree. The system is in an INCONSISTENT state.\n",
    "3) The INODE is written, but nothing else.\n",
    "    - The inode points to the data block, but the data block contains garbage. The file will likely get corrupted.\n",
    "    - The bitmap says its free so this data block might be allocated to a second file. If we have two files pointing to the same data block, they cna both corrupt each other at some distant point in the future.\n",
    "    - The user will lose data AND the sytem is in an INCONSISTENT state.\n",
    "4) The DATA BLOCK and BITMAP are written, but not the INODE.\n",
    "    - The system will be INCONSISTENT since the metadata disagrees.\n",
    "    - This is a space and the user loses data.\n",
    "5) The DATA BLOCK and INODE are written, but not the BITMAP.\n",
    "    - The system will be INCONSISTENT since the metadata disagrees.\n",
    "    - The data block can be allocated to a second file, leading to the same outcome\n",
    "    as case three.\n",
    "6) The BITMAP and INODE are written, but not the DATA BLOCK.\n",
    "    - The system will be consistent since the meta data agrees.\n",
    "    - The user loses data and the file is likely corrupted.\n"
