    "\n",
    "1) All of the users data, stored in files\n",
    "2) Per-file meta data: creation/modification time, permissions, size in bytes, # blocks required per file, ptrs to the blocks. \n",
    "3) Directories! Directories are just files. They contain a list of all files and directories within them."
