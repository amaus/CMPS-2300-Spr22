    "What do we need to store?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) All of the user's data, stored in files\n",
    "    - stored in **data blocks**\n",
    "2) Per-file meta data: creation/modification time, permissions, size in bytes, # blocks required per file, ptrs to the blocks. \n",
    "    - Metadata is stored in **inodes**. inodes are stored in **inodes blocks**.\n",
    "3) Directories! Directories are just files. They contain a list of all files and directories within them.\n",
    "4) A way to track which inode and data blocks are free.\n",
    "    - This is done using two bitmaps, the **inode blocks bitmap** and the **data blocks bitmap**\n",
    "5) Meta data for the entire file system: start/size of the data region, inodes region, bitmap locations, file system type, etc.\n",
    "    - Stored in the **super block**"
